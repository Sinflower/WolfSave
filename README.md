# WolfSave

A simple Wolf RPG save decrypter and encrypter, capable of turning a *.sav* file into a JSON file and back.

The different values are currently **NOT** properly mapped out and instead only numbered.

### Supported Versions

All Wolf RPG versions up to 3.279


### Usage ###
Drag and drop one or more *.sav* or *.json* file[s] onto the executable to decrypt or encrypt them.
